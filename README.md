# Graph Editor

Graph Editor is a very simple graph editor which can load and save in the
graphml format (and more to come).

It is written in python, with pyglet and networkx

## Installation

For now I do not support installation of the program, however you can just
run it from its folder.

## Dependencies

You need to have pyglet and networkx installed in your system. In Ubuntu
you can install them just by typing:

    sudo apt-get install python-pyglet python-networkx

## Running

Be sure to be in the base directory (that is the directory which contains
the file graph\_editor.py) and type in the terminal:

    python graph_editor.py
